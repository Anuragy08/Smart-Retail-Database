# Retail Database Analysis using SQL

## Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis of a simulated retail business using SQL. The dataset, published on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dillonmyrick/retail-database) by Dillon Myrick, includes information about customers, orders, products, staff, stores, and inventory.

The goal is to extract actionable insights using advanced SQL queries that support strategic retail decisions, such as customer segmentation, sales trends, product performance, and workforce optimization.
